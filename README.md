# OptimizationAlgorithms
An attempt to make an interface for all Optimization problems

[Work-inprogress]
The ultimate goal of thsi project is to create a self-optimizing optimization algorithm

The ultimate goal is create an optimization algorithm that optimizes optimizationalgorithms and can use it's own optimization solutions to improve itself and create better optimizations along the way.
The bets optimization algorithm will be chosen by which ones can best optimize on a wide variety of optimization problems.
